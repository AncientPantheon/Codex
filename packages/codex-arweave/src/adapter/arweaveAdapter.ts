/**
 * The Arweave `ForeignChainAdapter` — a thin conformance wrapper over the
 * shipped `arweave-core` primitives.
 *
 * D3 (`@ancientpantheon/codex-core`) owns the chain-agnostic `ForeignChainAdapter`
 * CONTRACT: it declares each method opaquely as `(...args: unknown[])` so the
 * generic package bakes in no Arweave concepts. E1 REFINES those placeholders
 * into concrete Arweave shapes here — generate/import/address/balance delegate to
 * `arweave-core`, and the transaction signer (`sign`/`post`/`buildSend`) is
 * stubbed until E2/Phase 12.
 *
 * getBalance ARITY (FIX-8): arweave-core's `getBalance(pool, address, opts?)`
 * needs a `GatewayPool`, but the refined PUBLIC surface is `getBalance(address)`
 * (arity 1). Rather than leak a pool into every call site, the pool is
 * CONSTRUCTOR-INJECTED via `createArweaveAdapter({ pool })` and closed over —
 * matching arweave-core's no-module-global-state discipline. An optional
 * `fetchFn` is likewise closed over and forwarded to arweave-core's injectable
 * fetch seam (so a consumer/test drives balance reads with zero real network).
 *
 * FUNDS-CRITICAL: no method here logs, echoes, or serializes any JWK private
 * field (`d`/`p`/`q`/`dp`/`dq`/`qi`). Errors surface UNWRAPPED from arweave-core
 * (which names the offending field only) so `instanceof` catches stay intact.
